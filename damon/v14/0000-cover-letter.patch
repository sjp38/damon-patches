Introduction
============

DAMON is a data access monitoring framework subsystem for the Linux kernel.
The core mechanisms of DAMON called 'region based sampling' and adaptive
regions adjustment' (refer to :doc:`mechanisms` for the detail) make it

 - accurate (The monitored information is useful for DRAM level memory
   management. It might not appropriate for Cache-level accuracy, though.),
 - ligfht-weight (The monitoring overhead is low enough to be applied online
   while making no impact on the performance of the target workloads.), and
 - scalable (the upper-bound of the instrumentation overhead is controllable
   regardless of the size of target workloads.).

Using this framework, therefore, the kernel's core memory management mechanisms
including reclamation and THP can be optimized for better memory management.
The experimental memory management optimization works that incurring high
instrumentation overhead will be able to have another try.  In user space,
meanwhile, users who have some special workloads will be able to write
personalized tools or applications for deeper understanding and specialized
optimizations of their systems.

Evaluations
===========

We evaluated DAMON's overhead, monitoring quality and usefulness using 25
realistic workloads on my QEMU/KVM based virtual machine running a kernel that
v13 DAMON patchset is applied.

DAMON is lightweight.  It increases system memory usage by only -0.39% and
consumes less than 1% CPU time in most case.  It slows target workloads down by
only 0.63%.

DAMON is accurate and useful for memory management optimizations.  An
experimental DAMON-based operation scheme for THP, 'ethp', removes 69.43% of
THP memory overheads while preserving 37.11% of THP speedup.  Another
experimental DAMON-based 'proactive reclamation' implementation, 'prcl',
reduces 89.30% of residential sets and 22.40% of system memory footprint while
incurring only 1.98% runtime overhead in the best case (parsec3/freqmine).

NOTE that the experimentail THP optimization and proactive reclamation are not
for production, just only for proof of concepts.

Please refer to the official document[1] or "Documentation/admin-guide/mm: Add
a document for DAMON" patch in this patchset for detailed evaluation setup and
results.

More Information
================

We prepared a showcase web site[1] that you can get more information.  There
are

- the official documentations[2],
- the heatmap format dynamic access pattern of various realistic workloads for
  heap area[3], mmap()-ed area[4], and stack[5] area,
- the dynamic working set size distribution[6] and chronological working set
  size changes[7], and
- the latest performance test results[8].

Baseline and Complete Git Trees
===============================

The patches are based on the v5.7.  You can also clone the complete git
tree:

    $ git clone git://github.com/sjp38/linux -b damon/patches/v14

The web is also available:
https://github.com/sjp38/linux/releases/tag/damon/patches/v14

There are a couple of trees for entire DAMON patchset series.  It includes
future features.  The first one[1] contains the changes for latest release,
while the other one[2] contains the changes for next release.

Sequence Of Patches
===================

The 1st patch exports 'lookup_page_ext()' to GPL modules so that it can be used
by DAMON even though it is built as a loadable module.

Next four patches implement the core of DAMON and it's programming interface.
The 2nd patch introduces DAMON module, it's data structures, and data structure
related common functions.  Following three patches (3rd to 5th) implements the
core mechanisms of DAMON, namely regions based sampling (patch 3), adaptive
regions adjustment (patch 4), and dynamic memory mapping chage adoption
(patch 5).

Following four patches are for low level users of DAMON.  The 6th patch
implements callbacks for each of monitoring steps so that users can do whatever
they want with the access patterns.  The 7th one implements recording of access
patterns in DAMON for better convenience and efficiency.  Each of next two
patches (8th and 9th) respectively adds a debugfs interface for privileged
people and/or programs in user space, and a tracepoint for other tracepoints
supporting tracers such as perf.

Two patches for high level users of DAMON follows.  To provide a minimal
reference to the debugfs interface and for high level use/tests of the DAMON,
the next patch (10th) implements an user space tool.  The 11th patch adds a
document for administrators of DAMON.

Next three patches are for tests.  The 12th and 13th patches provide unit tests
(based on the kunit) while the 14th patch adds user space tests (based on the
kselftest).

Finally, the last patch (15th) updates the MAINTAINERS file.
